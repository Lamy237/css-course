## Introduction

The [`position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties determine the final location of 
positioned elements.

The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.


## Types of positioning

The different types of positioning include:

| Position | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
|**static** | The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. (*default*) |
|**absolute** | The element is relative to the browser window, unless one of its parent containers is positioned `relative`. |
|**relative** | The element is always positioned relative to its closest ancestor. |
|**fixed** | The element is always positioned relative to the browser window. |
|**sticky** | The element is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed). |
