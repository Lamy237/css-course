## Types of selectors
There are three (03) types of basic selectors in CSS, including :
- Element selectors
- Class selectors
- ID selectors

### syntaxes
```css
/* Element selector */
body {
    font-size: 22px;
}

/* Element selector */
p {
    color: purple;
}

/* Class selector */
.gray {
    color: gray;
}

/* ID selector */
#second {
    font-style: italic;
}
```

## The Universal selector (\*)
Mainly used for a CSS reset, the universal selector selects every element on the page.

### Syntax
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Inheritence
**Inheritence :** is when another element inherits the properties from its parent element. For example, the `body` element is parent to all the elements on 
our page, so by setting the `font-size` on it, all other elements will inherit that font-size.

### Important
- Everything related to font or typography is inherited.
- Form elements do not inherit by default.

The following syntax can be used to make form elements inherit the font properties
```css
button, input, textarea, select {
  font: inherit;
}
```
