## Used Selectors

We can style links in CSS by selecting the anchor tag (*element selector*) often with pseudo-classes, to specify the link state on which the changes are to be applied.

| Selector        | Meaning                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `a`             | Selects all the states                                |
| `a:link`        | A link that has a destination                         |
| `a:visited`     | A link that has already been visited                  |
| `a:hover`       | A link that is hovered over by a user's mouse pointer |
| `a:focus`       | A link that is focused (*using the `Tab` key*)        |
| `a:active`      | A link that is activated (*by clicking on it*)        |
