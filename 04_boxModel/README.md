## Box Model Components

The [CSS Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model) has four (04) main components, including:

|Property                                                  | Functionality                                                |Preferred Unit  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------:|
|[`margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) |Creates space around elements, outside of any defined borders ([*See also*](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp)) |em, rem         |
|[`border`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) |Specifies the style, width, and color of an element's border ([*See also*](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp)) |px             |
|[`padding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) |Creates space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders |em, rem        |
|[`content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#content_area) |The actual content of the element, such as text, an image, or a video player |NA             |

### Important
The `margin` and `padding` of an element are generally relative to its `font-size`, which is why we use relative units (em, rem) to set them.


## The CSS Reset

Given that a default margin (*relative to the element's* `font-size`) is generally applied to block-level elements, we often need to apply a CSS reset to easily keep track of changes in the **Box Model**.

### Syntax
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```


## The property box-sizing

The property `box-sizing` can take two (02) values:
- content-box (*default*)
- border-box

### content-box
The value **content-box** implies that the size (*width, height*) we are setting only accounts for the element's [`content area`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model#content_area).

### border-box
The value **border-box** implies that the size we are setting includes the `border` and the `padding` (*not the margin, as it is outside the borders*). So regardless of the changes we apply, the total size (*width, height*) of the element will remain the same.


## The property outline
The property `outline` is not part of the **Box Model**. The difference between it and the `border` is that it doesn't take space but accept the same values as the border.
